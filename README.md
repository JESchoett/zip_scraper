# Data Scraper with Selenium and Requests

This Script is a Python-scraper i wrote to download all of the zip files within an Patreon collection i subscribet to.
(I was a bit to lazy to manualy download 500+ Files)

Attention!
This Script does not work, if you are using a Google account to login since they block Browsers opened by Selenium.
My guess is that Apple and Facebook will not work as well.
